## Datasets

| Dataset      | Description | SRA | Files |
| ------------ | ----------- | --- | ----- |
| Hou (2012)   | Single-cell and bulk sequencing of myeloproliferative neoplasm tissue from a single patient. Contains 58 single-cell cancer sequences, 1 normal tissue bulk sequence and 1 cancer tissue bulk sequence at 712 sites. Normal tissue genotypes are all homozygous wildtypes. Cancerous sequences can be homozygous wildtype, homozygous mutant or heterozygous. | SRA050202 | `mutations.csv` <br> <sub> _all sequences_ </sub> <br><br> `single_cell.csv` <br> <sub> _single-cells only in ternary format_ </sub> |
| Wu (2017)    | Single-cell and bulk sequencing of colorectal cancer tissue from two colorectal patients. Samples were collected from normal tissue, normal polyps, adenoma polyps and colorectal cancer. | SRP067815 |
| Leung (2016) | Single-cell sequencing of samples from a single colorectal cancer patient with liver metastasis. | SRP058890 |
